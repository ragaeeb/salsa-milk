A containerized CLI tool that isolates vocals from media files and YouTube videos using [Demucs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs) AI technology. Easily extract vocals from music videos or audio tracks with a single command.

## ‚ú® Features

- **High-Quality Vocal Isolation**: Uses Demucs, a state-of-the-art audio source separation model
- **Containerized**: Runs in a Podman/Docker container with all dependencies included
- **YouTube Support**: Process videos directly from YouTube URLs
- **Local Media Support**: Process local audio and video files
- **Preserve Video**: For video inputs, the video track is preserved with the isolated vocals
- **Customizable Output**: Choose your output directory
- **Memory Management**: Adjust memory allocation for larger files

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Podman (v4.0+) or Docker
- Bash-compatible shell

### macOS Installation

1. Install Podman using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install podman
```

2. Initialize and start the Podman machine:

```bash
podman machine init
podman machine start
```

3. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ragaeeb/salsa-milk.git
cd salsa-milk
```

4. Build the container:

```bash
./build.sh
```

### Linux Installation

1. Install Podman (using your package manager):

For Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y podman
```

For Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install -y podman
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ragaeeb/salsa-milk.git
cd salsa-milk
```

3. Build the container:

```bash
./build.sh
```

### Using Docker instead of Podman

The installation works the same with Docker. Simply substitute `docker` for `podman` in the commands. Edit the `salsa-milk.sh` script to use Docker instead of Podman.

## üéÆ Usage

### Basic Usage

Process a local video file:
```bash
./salsa-milk.sh video.mp4
```

Process a YouTube video:
```bash
./salsa-milk.sh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
```

Process multiple files:
```bash
./salsa-milk.sh video1.mp4 video2.mp4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
```

### Options

- `-m MEMORY`: Set memory limit (default: 12g)
```bash
./salsa-milk.sh -m 16g video.mp4
```

- `-o DIRECTORY`: Set output directory (default: current directory)
```bash
./salsa-milk.sh -o ~/vocals video.mp4
```

Combine options:
```bash
./salsa-milk.sh -m 16g -o ~/vocals video.mp4
```

### Rebuilding the Container

If you need to rebuild the container (e.g., after updating the code):
```bash
./build.sh --clean
```

## üîß Technical Details

- **Container Image**: Uses Python `3.13-slim` with necessary dependencies
- **Caching**: Demucs models are cached in `~/.cache/salsa-milk` for faster processing
- **Temporary Files**: All intermediate files are stored in temporary directories and cleaned up on exit
- **Memory Usage**: Default memory allocation is `12GB`, can be adjusted with the `-m` option
